## Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO). This means the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first.

### Basic Operations

- **Push**: Add an element to the top of a stack
- **Pop**: Remove an element from the top of a stack
- **IsEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty
- **IsFull**: Check if the stack is full
- **Peek**: Get the value of the top element without removing it

### Time Complexity

For the array-based implementation of a stack, all the operations mentioned above have **O(1)** ie. constant time complexity.
